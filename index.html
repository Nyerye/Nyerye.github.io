        <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
        <p>This website was made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages. I decided to use the GitHub Pages product to create my own 
		portfolio page and be able to use this wesbite as a way to demonstrate my knowledge in web programming languages. This website
		serves as a project to showcase my proficency in these languages.

		<h2>About Me</h1>
		<p> I have been in the IT Industry for almost 10 years, with my start in retail at Apple as a Lead Technician. 
		Over the pandemic, I was reassigned to Apple's main call center where I was able to take a leadership position and manage a team of 20 people. 
		When I returned, I was able to also showcase my skills in sales and won numerous awards for exceptional customer service and sales metrics.
		But after being with Apple for a long time, I wanted to do more enterprise IT consulting and be able to grow a career. I decided to challenge myself
		and enter the healthcare industry as an IT technician shortly after the pandemic's peak. It was after that I was offered an oppourtunity to work for the Region of 
		Waterloo as a full time ITS Consultant. in my time as an ITS Consultant, I was exposed to working on many bigger projects with mutiple departments and stakeholders.
		While being exposed to low and high level languages, database languages and webpage languages, my passion for development was reingnited. I decided to go back
		and resume my education while taking on a different role. My desire for innovation, dedication to customer satisfaction and my motivation for problem solving is well recognized by my peers. 
		I look forward to discussing how my skills and experience may align with your company.
		
		Sincerely,
		Nicholas Reilly
