        <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
        <p>This website was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages. I decided to use the GitHub Pages product to create my own 
        portfolio page and demonstrate my knowledge in web programming languages. This website serves as a project to showcase my proficiency in these languages.</p>
        
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I have been in the IT Industry for almost 10 years, starting at Apple as a Lead Technician. Over the pandemic, I transitioned to Apple's main call center, where I took on a leadership role managing a team of 20 people. My experience includes awards for exceptional customer service and sales metrics. After joining the healthcare industry as an IT technician, I was offered an opportunity to work for the Region of Waterloo as an ITS Consultant. Here, I gained exposure to larger projects, multiple departments, and stakeholders. My passion for development was reignited, leading me to return to education and expand my skills. My commitment to innovation, customer satisfaction, and problem-solving is well recognized by my peers. I look forward to discussing how my skills and experience align with your company.</p>
